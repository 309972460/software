Help us.


Everyone from the PHC team is working on that 
project in his/her own spare time. We all have
our families and our jobs to do.

If you think you can spend some time helping us
with helping others feel free to do so.

Be present in the irc-channel and the forum if 
you like.

Help us updating some documents if you can.

Fix some bugs if you know how.

Port the patches to newer Kernels if you like
to (thats really easy).

Help us developing new patches - thats what we
need most: more developers.


Thank you.
