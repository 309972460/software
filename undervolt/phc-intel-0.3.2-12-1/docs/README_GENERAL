1 - Description
    This is the phc offtree package for Intel CPUs.
    It is based on the default linux-phc patches and the stock acpi-cpufreq module taken from a vanilla kernel.
    The new module will be named "phc-intel.ko" instead of "acpi-cpufreq.ko" but it is the same, just patched with PHC.
      
    We made this package so you can compile the PHC module outside the kernel tree (to make it easier to you).


2 - Preconditions
    You need to have at least your kernel-headers installed.
    You need a Kernel where acpi-cpufreq is compiled as module (or is not compiled at all).
    You also need the build essentials (gcc, libc, make, etc).



3 - Build your Module
    Open a console and change the directory to where you extracted the offtree-package.
  
    To build your module, type	
        make
    This will prepare and compile the module.
 
    Then, type	
        sudo make install
    This will copy the new module (phc-intel.ko) to the kernel directory and run depmod.
    If you want to test this module before installing it, just unload your original module
    using "rmmod" or "modprobe -r" and load your new one using "insmod".
    Remember, the new module is named "phc-intel.ko".

    Run some test with it or what ever you like to.

    If you install it without testing, then unload the old (stock) module and
    load your new one the same way like mentioned above.
