UBUNTU README addon

This file adds some information to the general README if you are using UBUNTU.



Why this README for UBUNTU?

   The Ubuntu developers decided to compile cpufreq drivers into the
   Kernel for some reasons. Different to a driver that is compiled
   as a module, the compiled-in ones can not be replaced.

   You need another Kernel. Either self-made or provided by some nice guys.


   If you want to compile your own Kernel you should take a look into the Ubuntu Forums.
   There are a lot of good howto's. Many of them are well written and
   understandable for beginners.

   If you want a replacement Kernel as a Deb-Package for easy installing you can
   use those from our PPA (Personal Package Archive). Further information about
   that can be found in our Forum.

   Please say "thank you" to the guy who provides that PPA, he really deserve it.
