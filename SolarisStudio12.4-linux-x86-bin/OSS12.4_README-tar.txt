Oracle Linux systems, and Red Hat Linux systems.

======================================
System Packages and Patches for Solaris 10
======================================
The Systems Requirements in the Oracle Solaris Studio 12.4
Release Notes state the versions of the operating systems that are
supported.

For a complete list of Oracle Solaris system packages required to
run Oracle Solaris Studio 12.4, review the

Required System Software Packages in  the
Oracle Solaris Studio 12.4 Release Notes
http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E37069_01/html/E37070/index.html

Required patches are included with the Oracle Solaris Studio 12.4
product distribution.

If you did not already install the included Oracle Solaris 10 patches
while running the GUI installer, install them as root:

   # ./install_patches.sh

======================================
Post Installation - PATH/MANPATH setup
======================================
Because the Oracle Solaris Studio 12.4 software product components
and man pages are not installed into the system directories /usr/bin/
and /usr/share/man, you may need to change your PATH and MANPATH
environment variables to use the Oracle Solaris Studio 12.4
software.

in the Oracle Solaris Studio 12.4 Installation Guide:
