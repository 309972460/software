MALIGNO v2.1 -> v2.2
=====================

1. Adjustments to get caught mode have been introduced. This mode sends now random data with random length as payload.
   Maligno server will not generate metasploit payloads when get caught mode is enabled. This means that no metasploit payload is sent to Maligno client in get caught mode.
2. Clients will not inject  and execute the payload when get caught mode is enabled.
3. Adjustments to Clientgen for implementing changes related to get caught mode.
4. Clientgen now generates one single client file when get caught mode is enabled.
5. Print warning function added to output routines.
6. Threads are now started as daemon in order to finish properly when the server is stopped.
7. Fixed a bug that prevented payload IDs from being alphanumerical strings.
8. Payload spawn time increased to 30 seconds in perpetual mode.
9. Minor bug fixes.
10. New adversary replication profile "oldrea.xml".
